Reflection 

1. **What did you observe about the app lifecycle when switching between screens or minimizing the app?**
   
I observed that when switching between screens or minimizing the app, the app lifecycle changes and some methods like onPause() and onStop() are called. It helps Android manage memory and performance better.

3.** What did you learn about activity management in Android?**

I learned that activity management in Android controls how each screen behaves and interacts. It makes sure the right activity is shown and saves data when switching between them.
